In this game, the player is a spaceship pilot and must maneuver their way through sets of asteroids. To move the spaceship, the player must simply move their mouse. The player starts with 3 lives and loses them if they hit an asteroid. Furthermore to enhance the gaming experience, powerups are available for the player to use. They will spawn like an asteroid, but have unique sprites. There are many kinds of power ups ranging from shields to time slowing. There also is a scoring system in place, the higher your score, the more asteroids will spawn. Compete with your friends!
